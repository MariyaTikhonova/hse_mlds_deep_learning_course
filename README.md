# Deep learning course for HSE Masterâ€™s Programme "Machine Learning and Data-Intensive Systems" [[videos]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDa1nku7NnMlRfI3jvKJ7mzYPXrHafQY5)

#### This course is strongly based on materials from other great HSE DL courses:
1. https://github.com/hse-ds/iad-deep-learning
2. https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL

All used materials from other cources has corresponding references.

# Grading [[grades]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HsnOGvWdisYb4MHoCPfKvdNIit2IohSrhOayFPP_Q00/edit?usp=sharing)

Your Grade = round(0.3 * hw_1  + 0.3 * hw_2 + 0.3 * hw_3 + 0.1 * exam)

Also, some weeks contain additional homeworks with extra points

# Homeworks
### Submission
All homework assignments should be sent to me personally in slack with the names:

**"{surname}\_\_hw\_{number}\.zip"** or **"{surname}\_\_ehw\_{week_number}\.zip"** (for extra homeworks).

### Deadlines 
The deadline for completing homework will be announced along with the homework.

Deadline for every extra homework **is next seminar**.
