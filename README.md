# Deep learning course for HSE Masterâ€™s Programme "Machine Learning and Data-Intensive Systems"

#### This course is strongly based on materials from other great HSE DL courses:
1. https://github.com/hse-ds/iad-deep-learning
2. https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL

All used materials from other cources has corresponding references.
