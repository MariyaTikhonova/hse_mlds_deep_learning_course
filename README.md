# Deep learning course for HSE Masterâ€™s Programme "Machine Learning and Data-Intensive Systems" 

## Basic Info

Course page can be found via this [link](http://wiki.cs.hse.ru/.%D0%93%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%9C%D0%9E%D0%B8%D0%92%D0%A1-2022-2023)

Seminars: **[Wednesday 18.00](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/158tztQ-jFFErWMk7k3INnSs8tjDTWP9j1SBE-uxFfMw/edit)** 
 
This course was originally developed by [pet67](https://github.com/pet67) and is strongly based on materials from other great HSE DL courses:
1. https://github.com/hse-ds/iad-deep-learning
2. https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL

All used materials from other courses has corresponding references.

Material from the previous session of the course can be found in [main branch](https://github.com/pet67/hse_mlds_deep_learning_course) of the repository.

# Grading

Your Final Grade = round(0.3 * hw_1  + 0.3 * hw_2 + 0.3 * hw_3 + 0.1 * exam)

Your Grade in the 4th module will be calculated based on your HW results.

# Homeworks
## Submission
All homework assignments should be send via [AnyTask](https://anytask.org). Invite for the course is **PKivb1Q**.


You may send the google collab link but ensure that you **have given access via the link**. The best way is to send both: ipynb itself and the link to collab. It is also better to name the files like this:

**"{surname}\_\_hw\_{number}\.ipynb"** or **"{surname}\_\_ehw\_{week_number}\.ipynb"** (for extra homeworks).

### Deadlines 
The deadline for completing homework will be announced along with the homework.
