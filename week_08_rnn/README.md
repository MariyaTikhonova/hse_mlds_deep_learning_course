## Homework NLP (NOT optional)
We will solve [iad-deep-learning nlp homework](https://github.com/hse-ds/iad-deep-learning/blob/master/2021/homeworks/hw03/hw3_kaggle.ipynb) with slight changes in scoring system:

Part 1: not only tf-idf needs to be done, but also "tf" and bag of words. Do a little comparison report.

Part 3: you need to make vanilla RNN, LSTM, transformer and use pre-trained bert. (each 1 point). Do a little comparison report.
